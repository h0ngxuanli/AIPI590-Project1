{"prompt": "Anna goes trick-or-treating in a subdivision where she gets 14 pieces of candy per house. Her brother Billy goes trick-or-tricking in a neighboring subdivision where he gets 11 pieces of candy per house. If the first subdivision has 60 houses and the second subdivision has 75 houses, how many more pieces of candy does Anna get?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Anna gets 14 pieces of candy per house. \nThere are 60 houses in the first subdivision. \nAnna gets 60 * 14 = 840 pieces of candy from the first subdivision. \n\nBilly gets 11 pieces of candy per house. \nThere are 75 houses in the second subdivision. \nBilly gets 75 * 11 = 825 pieces of candy from the second subdivision. \n\nAnna gets 840 pieces of candy and Billy gets 825 pieces of candy. \nAnna gets 840 - 825 = 15 more pieces of candy than Billy.\n\n-->\n\n15 END"}
{"prompt": "Farmer Brown fed 7 chickens and 5 sheep. How many total legs were there among the animals he fed?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to find the number of legs for each type of animal. \nFor chickens, we know that each chicken has 2 legs. So we have 2 times 7, which is 14. \nFor sheep, we know that each sheep has 4 legs. So we have 4 times 5, which is 20. \nNow we need to add these two numbers together to get our final answer. \n14 + 20 is 34. \nSo the total number of legs among the animals that Farmer Brown fed is 34.\n\n-->\n\n34 END"}

How many matches does he have left?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nate starts with 70 matches. \nHe loses 10 in a creek. \nThat means he now has 60 matches. \nThen his dog eats twice as many, which would be 20 matches. \nThat would leave him with 40 matches in the end.\n\n-->\n\n40 END"}
{"prompt": "If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena is, and in 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than her, how old is Pam now?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We know that Pam is currently twice as young as Rena. So, if we let x represent Rena's age, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x = Pam's age\n\nWe also know that in 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam. So, we can set up another equation:\n\n2x + 10 = x + 5\n\nWe can solve for x in the first equation, and plug that value into the second equation. \n\n2x = x + 5\n2x - x = x + 5 - x\nx = 5\n\nNow we\n\n-->\n\n5 END"}
