{"prompt": "Can you taste Law & Order?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, let's consider what it would mean to \"taste\" something.

For example, we might taste something and identify it as being sweet, salty, or sour. \n\nNow, let's think about what it would mean to \"taste\" Law & Order. Law & Order is a television show, not a food. Therefore, it would not make sense to use our sense of taste to try to identify certain qualities of the show.
