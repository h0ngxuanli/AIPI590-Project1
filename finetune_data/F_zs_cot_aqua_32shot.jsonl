{"prompt": "If 60 J of energy are available for every 15 C of charge, what is the voltage? Answer choices: (A) 4V, (B) 3V, (C) 7V, (D) 9, (E) 2.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " We know that we have 60 J of energy for every 15 C of charge. \nWe also know that 1 J = 1 V * 1 C. \nTherefore, we can say that 60 J = 60 V * 1 C. \nNow we just need to divide both sides by 15 C to get the voltage. \n\n60 J / 15 C = 4 V \n\nTherefore, the answer is (A) 4 V.\n\n-->\n\nA END"}

{"prompt": "In a certain game, a large bag is filled with blue, green, purple and red chips worth 1, 5, x and 11 points each, respectively. The purple chips are worth more than the green chips, but less than the red chips. A certain number of chips are then selected from the bag. If the product of the point values of the selected chips is 28160, how many purple chips were selected? Answer choices: (A) 1, (B) 2, (C) 3, (D) 4, (E) 5.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The product of the point values of the selected chips is 28160. \n\nSince the product is even, we know that an even number of chips must have been selected. \n\nSince 1 * 5 * 11 = 55, we know that at least one of each type of chip must have been selected. \n\nThis means that the only possible combination is 1 blue chip, 1 green chip, 1 purple chip, and 2 red chips. \n\nTherefore, the answer is (C).\n\n-->\n\nC END"}
