There were 15 roses and 62 orchids, which equals 77 flowers in total. Then, Jessica added more roses and orchids to the vase, so now there are 17 roses and 96 orchids. This equals 113 flowers in total. We need to find out how many flowers Jessica added, so we need to subtract 77 from 113. 113-77=36. This means that Jessica added 36 flowers to the vase.
