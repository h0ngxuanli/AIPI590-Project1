Do bumblebees have the ability to be aware of their own mortality? It's doubtful. Studies have shown that even animals as complex as chimpanzees and gorillas do not have a concept of death.

In fact, Wilson was a known racist, and he once said that \"segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit.\"\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}
