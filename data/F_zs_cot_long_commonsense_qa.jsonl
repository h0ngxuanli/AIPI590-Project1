A company is bankrupt when it cannot pay its debts. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but usually it is because the company is not making enough money to cover its expenses. So, the first thing that happens when a company goes bankrupt is that it stops paying its debts.\n\nNext, the company's assets are sold off to pay its creditors. This is called liquidation. Liquidation can be either voluntary or involuntary. In voluntary liquidation, the company's shareholders vote to sell off the company's assets. In involuntary liquidation, a court orders the company's assets to be sold off.\n\nAfter the company's assets are sold off, the company is dissolved. This means that it no longer exists as a legal entity. The company's shareholders no longer have any ownership stake in the company, and the company's creditors are no longer owed any money.\n\nSo, what happens to a company when it is bankrupt? Its assets are sold off, it is dissolved, and its shareholders and creditors no longer have any legal claim to the company.\n\n-->\n\nA END"}

This increases the volume of your thoracic cavity and creates a vacuum. Since air always moves from areas of high pressure to low pressure, the air outside rushes in to equalize the pressure. The air enters through your nose or mouth, and then travels down your trachea (windpipe) and into your lungs. \n\nYour lungs are spongy, elastic organs that are divided into sections called lobes. The air then travels through the bronchial tubes, which branch off into smaller and smaller tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. \n\nThe alveoli are surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. When the air reaches the alveoli, oxygen diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood in the capillaries and into the alveoli. \n\nSo, in short, humans take in oxygen while breathing.\n\n-->\n\nB END"}

But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

Let's think about what each of these could mean. \n\n(B) let down could mean that the person is lowered into the water by some other means, such as a rope or a crane. However, this doesn't seem to fit with the idea of human-powered transportation. \n\n(E) row boat makes more sense as a human-powered type of water transportation.

{"prompt": "If competing with others what emotion is useful for getting an advantage?

An advantage means that you are better off than someone else in a particular situation. In order to have an advantage over someone else, you need to be able to do something that they cannot do, or be better at something than they are.\n\nNow, let's think about which emotion would be most useful in this situation. Stress might make you more focused and help you to better control your emotions, but it is also likely to make you more tense and increase your heart rate, which could negatively impact your performance. Anger might make you more aggressive and help you to push yourself harder, but it is also likely to make you more impulsive and less able to think clearly. Pumped might make you more enthusiastic and help you to get into a flow state, but it is also likely to make you more reckless and less able to control your movements. Defeat might make you more determined to win, but it is also likely to make you more likely to give up if you feel like you are losing.\n\nSo, which emotion is most useful for getting an advantage? In this situation, aggression is likely to be the most useful emotion. Aggression will help you to push yourself harder, to be more focused, and to be more determined to win. It is important to note, however, that aggression should be controlled and directed in order to be effective. If you become too aggressive, you may become reckless and make mistakes.\n\n-->\n\nE END"}

However, there are also many places in downtown areas that are perfectly safe.

However, like with the previous answer choices, there are also many places on the ocean floor that are perfectly safe.

With that in mind, we can eliminate some of the answer choices. For example, it's unlikely that the post office would have high tech computers, because they don't need to be new or advanced to do their job. \n\nThat leaves us with the space shuttle, the library, the internet cafe, and MIT. All of these could potentially have high tech computers, but we need to narrow it down further. The space shuttle is likely to have very new and advanced computers, because they need to be able to handle a lot of data and be very reliable. The library is also likely to have high tech computers, because they need to be able to handle a lot of data (in the form of books) and be accessible to a lot of people. The internet cafe is likely to have high tech computers because they need to be able to handle a lot of data (in the form of internet traffic) and be accessible to a lot of people.\n\nSo, all of these are potential answers, but the most likely answer is the space shuttle.\n\n-->\n\nA END"}

It is a conjunction, which means it connects two clauses. In this sentence, the first clause is \"Sam would cry\" and the second clause is \"he watched Old Yeller.\" \n\nThe conjunction \"when\" indicates that the two clauses are connected in time. In other words, Sam crying is happening at the same time as him watching Old Yeller. \n\nNow that we know the two clauses are connected in time, we can look at the verb in each clause. The first clause, \"Sam would cry,\" is in the past tense. The second clause, \"he watched Old Yeller,\" is in the present tense. \n\nThis means that the crying happened in the past, while the watching is happening in the present. \n\nNow that we know when the crying and the watching are happening, we can look at the emotion each verb expresses. \n\nThe verb \"cry\" expresses sadness, while the verb \"watch\" does not express any emotion. \n\nThis means that the correct answer is (A), \"were sad.\"\n\n-->\n\nA END"}

One possibility is that Greg is not very diligent; he doesn't put in the extra effort to make sure his work is of high quality.

If they experienced the physical changes associated with aging, then they would likely go through the same changes that adults do - they would grow taller, their bones would get stronger, etc. If they experienced the mental changes associated with aging, then they might start to think about things differently than they did when they were younger.

If they experienced the physical changes associated with aging, then the consequences would likely be the same as the consequences for adults - they would be able to do things that they couldn't do when they were younger, like vote, drive, etc. If they experienced the mental changes associated with aging, then the consequences could be either positive or negative.
