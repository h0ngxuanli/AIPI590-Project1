So Joe paid 1/4 of the fine plus $6. \nPeter paid $6 less than 1/3 of the fine. So Peter paid 1/3 of the fine minus $6. \n\nThis means that Sam paid 1/4 of the fine plus $6, plus 1/3 of the fine minus $6. \n\nWe can simplify this a little bit. 1/4 of the fine is the same thing as 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine. And 1/3 of the fine is the same thing as 1/9 of the fine plus 1/9 of the fine plus 1/9 of the fine. \n\nSo Sam paid 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine plus 1/12 of the fine, plus 1/9 of the fine plus 1/9 of the fine plus 1/9 of the fine, plus $6, minus $6. \n\nThis is the same thing as 1/2 of the fine.

From this, we can set up the following equation: \n\nUpstream time = 2 * Downstream time \n\nNow, we can use the equation for speed to solve for the man's speed in the stream: \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time \n\nUpstream speed = Distance / (2 * Downstream time) \nDownstream speed = Distance / Downstream time \n\nNow that we have the man's speed in the stream, we can use the equation for speed to solve for the stream's speed: \n\nSpeed = Distance / Time \n\nStream speed = (Upstream speed - Downstream speed) / 2 \n\n= ((Distance / (2 * Downstream time)) - (Distance / Downstream time)) / 2 \n= (Distance / (2 * Downstream time) - Distance / Downstream time) / 2 \n= Distance / (2 * (2 * Downstream time)) \n= Distance / (4 * Downstream time) \n\nNow that we have the stream's speed, we can plug in the given values to solve: \n\nStream speed = Distance / (4 * Downstream time) \nStream speed = (42 kmph * Downstream time) / (4 * Downstream time) \nStream speed = 42 kmph / 4 \nStream speed = 10.5 kmph\n\n-->\n\nC END"}

Answer choices: (A) 144, (B) 36, (C) 124, (D) 26, (E) 38.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to find the circumference of the circle. \nThe circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * r. \nThe radius of the circle is 380/2 = 190. \nTherefore, the circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * 190 = 1196. \nNow we need to find the speed of each person in terms of circumference. \nThe speed of the first person is 24 kmph. \n1 km = 1000 m. \nTherefore, 24 kmph = 24000 m/h. \nSince we need the speed in terms of circumference, we need to convert hours to minutes. \nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. \nTherefore, 24000 m/h = 24000 * (1 h/60 min) = 400 m/min. \nSimilarly, the speed of the second person is 28 kmph. \nTherefore, 28 kmph = 28000 m/h = 466.7 m/min. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track once. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track once is the circumference divided by the speed. \nTherefore, the time it will take for the first person to go around the track once is 1196/400 = 2.99 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track once is 1196/466.7 = 2.56 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track twice. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track twice is 2.99 * 2 = 5.98 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track twice is 2.56 * 2 = 5.12 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track three times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track three times is 2.99 * 3 = 8.97 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track three times is 2.56 * 3 = 7.68 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track four times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track four times is 2.99 * 4 = 11.96 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track four times is 2.56 * 4 = 10.24 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track five times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track five times is 2.99 * 5 = 14.95 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track five times is 2.56 * 5 = 12.8 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track six times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track six times is 2.99 * 6 = 17.94 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track six times is 2.56 * 6 = 15.36 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track seven times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track seven times is 2.99 * 7 = 20.93 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track seven times is 2.56 * 7 = 17.92 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track eight times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track eight times is 2.99 * 8 = 23.92 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track eight times is 2.56 * 8 = 20.48 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track nine times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track nine times is 2.99 * 9 = 26.91 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track nine times is 2.56 * 9 = 23.04 minutes. \nNow we need to find the time it will take for each person to go around the track ten times. \nThe time it will take for the first person to go around the track ten times is 2.99 * 10 = 29.9 minutes. \nSimilarly, the time it will take for the second person to go around the track ten times is 2.56 * 10 = 25.6 minutes. \nTherefore, the two persons will meet for the first time anywhere on the track after 25.6 minutes.\n\n-->\n\nD END"}

Answer choices: (A) 25%, (B) 19%, (C) 30%, (D) 22.5%, (E) 15%.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The original price was increased by 40%. So, if we call the original price x, then the new price would be 1.4x. \nThe new price was then decreased by 15%. So, the final price would be 1.4x - 0.15(1.4x) = 1.185x. \n\nTo find the equivalent single increase, we want to find a percent increase that would result in a final price of 1.185x. \n\n1.185x = 1 + r(x)\n1.185 = 1 + r\nr = 0.185\n\nTherefore, the equivalent single increase is 18.5%.\n\n-->\n\nB END"}

Therefore, 63,000 m/hr is equal to 63,000/3600 m/s, which is equal to 17.5 m/s. \n\nNow we have the speed of the train in m/s. The next step is to find the distance the train will travel in the time it takes to cross the tunnel. \n\nWe know that the train is travelling at 17.5 m/s. We also know that it takes the train 40 seconds to cross the tunnel. \n\nWe can use the equation d = vt, which means distance equals velocity times time. \n\nWe know the velocity (17.5 m/s) and the time (40 seconds), so we can solve for distance. \n\n17.5 m/s * 40 seconds = 700 m \n\nThe train will travel 700 m in 40 seconds. \n\nWe also know that the tunnel is 285 m long. \n\n700 m is greater than 285 m, so we know that it will take the train less than 40 seconds to cross the tunnel. \n\nThe answer is (E) 40.\n\n-->\n\nE END"}

Answer choices: (A) 38., (B) 40., (C) 66., (D) 44., (E) 46..\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The roof is rectangular, so it has four sides. \nTwo of those sides are the length, and the other two are the width. \nThe length is 7 times longer than the width, so that means the width is 1/7th the size of the length. \nThe area of the roof is 847 feet squared. \n\nNow we have all the information we need to solve for the length and the width. \n\nThe area of a rectangle is equal to the length times the width. So, 847 = 7l * (1/7)w. \nWe can solve this equation for w by multiplying both sides by 7/7. 847 = 7l * (1/7)w becomes 847 = 7l * w. \nNow we can solve for w by dividing both sides by 7. 847/7 = 7l/7 * w/7 becomes 121 = l * w. \nWe know that w = 1/7l, so we can plug that in for w in our equation. 121 = l * (1/7l) becomes 121 = l * 1/7l. \nWe can solve this equation for l by multiplying both sides by 7/7. 121 = l * 1/7l becomes 121 = 7/7l * 1/7l. \nNow we can solve for l by dividing both sides by 1/7l. 121/1/7l = 7/7l * 1/7l/1/7l becomes 121 * 7l/1 = l. \nWe can solve this equation for l by multiplying both sides by 7l. 121 * 7l/1 * 7l/7l becomes 847 = l. \n\nSo the length of the roof is 847 feet, and the width of the roof is 121/847 feet. \n\nThe difference between the length and the width is 847 - 121/847 = 847 - 1/7 = 740/7. \n\nThe answer is (C).\n\n-->\n\nC END"}

{"prompt": "The function F is defined for all positive integers n by the following rule: f(n) is the number of position integer each of which is less than n, and has no position factor in common with n other than 1.

This just means that they don't share any prime factors - so for example, 12 and 15 have no position factor in common because 12's prime factors are 2 and 3, while 15's prime factors are 3 and 5. \n\nNow, what does it mean for a number to be less than n? This just means that it's smaller than n. So for example, if n = 12, then a number like 10 would be less than n. \n\nFinally, what does it mean for a number to be a positive integer? This just means that it's a whole number greater than 0. So for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. are all positive integers. \n\nNow that we know what the question is asking, let's try to answer it. \n\nIf p is any prime number, then f(p) is the number of positive integers less than p that have no position factor in common with p. In other words, f(p) is the number of positive integers less than p that don't share any prime factors with p. \n\nSo how can we find f(p)? Well, we know that p is a prime number, which means that it has no prime factors other than itself. This means that the only positive integers that have no position factor in common with p are numbers that are also prime. \n\nSo f(p) is just the number of prime numbers less than p. For example, if p = 10, then the prime numbers less than 10 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So f(10) = 4. \n\nAs another example, if p = 7, then the prime numbers less than 7 are 2, 3, and 5. So f(7) = 3. \n\nIn general, we can say that f(p) = p-1, because there are p-1 prime numbers less than p. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A).\n\n-->\n\nA END"}

{"prompt": "Some of the people in Town F are left-handed, some are tall, some are both, and some are neither. In Town Y, three times as many people are left-handed > as are left-handed in Town F, three times as many people are tall as are tall in Town F, three times as many people are both as are both in Town F, but no one is neither. If the total number of people in Town F is four times greater than the total number of people in Town Y, which of the following could be the number of people in Town F who are neither left-handed nor tall? Answer choices: (A) 23, (B) 39, (C) 72, (D) 143, (E) 199.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we know that the number of people in Town F who are left-handed is three times the number of people in Town Y who are left-handed. \n\nSecond, we know that the number of people in Town F who are tall is three times the number of people in Town Y who are tall. \n\nThird, we know that the number of people in Town F who are both left-handed and tall is three times the number of people in Town Y who are both left-handed and tall. \n\nFourth, we know that the total number of people in Town F is four times greater than the total number of people in Town Y. \n\nNow, we can set up the following equation: \n\n3L + 3T + 3(L&T) = 4(L+T+L&T+N)\n\nWhere L is the number of left-handed people, T is the number of tall people, L&T is the number of people who are both left-handed and tall, and N is the number of people who are neither left-handed nor tall. \n\nWe can simplify this equation to get: \n\n3L + 3T + 3L&T = 16(L+T+N)\n\nNow, we can plug in the values that we know. We know that there are three times as many left-handed people in Town F as in Town Y, so L = 3Y. We also know that there are three times as many tall people in Town F as in Town Y, so T = 3Y. And we know that there are three times as many people who are both left-handed and tall in Town F as in Town Y, so L&T = 3Y. Plugging these values into our equation, we get: \n\n3(3Y) + 3(3Y) + 3(3Y) = 16(3Y + 3Y + 3Y + N)\n\n9Y + 9Y + 9Y = 48Y + 48N\n\n27Y = 48Y + 48N\n\n27Y = 96Y + 48N\n\n-69Y = 48N\n\nN = -69Y/48\n\nNow, we need to find a value for Y that will make N a whole number. We know that the total number of people in Town F is four times greater than the total number of people in Town Y, so we can set up the following equation: \n\n4F = Y\n\nF = Y/4\n\nNow, we can plug Y/4 into our equation for N: \n\nN = -69(Y/4)/48\n\nN = -69Y/192\n\nWe need to find a value for Y that will make N a whole number. One value that will work is 96. If Y = 96, then N = -69(96)/192 = -69(24) = -1656. However, this is not a whole number, so it is not a possible answer. \n\nAnother value that will work is 288. If Y = 288, then N = -69(288)/192 = -69(144) = -9936. This is a whole number, so it is a possible answer. \n\nThe only possible answer is (E).\n\n-->\n\nD END"}

x\n\nWe can add 12y to both sides of the first equation: \n\n30x + 12y = 1800\n30x + 12y + 12y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation: \n\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can subtract 12y from both sides of the equation: \n\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n42y = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 42: \n\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can subtract 1800 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can subtract 12y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\ny = 1800 + 12y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 12: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0 + y = 150 + y + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 2: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y + y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 2y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 300 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 2: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0 + y = 150 + y + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 2: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y + y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 2y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 300 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 2: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\ny = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0 + y = 150 + y + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n0 + y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 2: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n0.5y = 150 + y\n\nWe can subtract y from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + y + y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 150 + 2y\n\nWe can subtract 150 from both sides of the equation: \n\ny = 150 + y\n0 + 0.5y = 150 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n0.5y = 300 + 2y\n\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 0.5: \n\ny = 150 + y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\ny = 300 + 2y\n\n-->\n\nC END"}

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides is equal to the square of the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we know that the hypotenuse is 40, so we can square that to get 1600.

L invests Rs.16000 for 8 months and L remains in the business for 4 months.\n\nThis means that L's investment was Rs.16,000 for 8 months, or a total of Rs.128,000. \n\nOut of the total profit B claims 2/7th share.\n\nWe're looking for B's share of the total profit. We're given that B's share is 2/7, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nB's share * total profit = 2/7\n\nWe don't know the total profit, so we'll solve for it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 7/2:\n\n(7/2) * B's share * total profit = (7/2) * (2/7)\n\n7/2 * B's share * total profit = 1\n\nB's share * total profit = 2/7\n\nNow we know that B's share of the total profit is 2/7.

We can set this up as an equation:\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 + B's investment\n\nWe can plug in what we know about B's share of the total profit:\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 + (2/7) * total profit\n\nWe can solve this equation for total profit:\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 / (1 - (2/7))\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 / (5/7)\n\ntotal profit = Rs.737,143.43\n\nThis means that the total profit was Rs.737,143.43. We can plug this back into our equation for B's share of the total profit:\n\n(2/7) * total profit = (2/7) * Rs.737,143.43\n\nB's share of the total profit = Rs.105,734.78\n\nThis means that B's share of the total profit was Rs.105,734.78. We can plug this back into our equation for the total profit:\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 + B's investment\n\ntotal profit = Rs.128,000 + Rs.105,734.78\n\ntotal profit = Rs.233,734.78\n\nThis means that the total profit was Rs.233,734.78. We can plug this back into our equation for B's share of the total profit:\n\nB's share * total profit = 2/7\n\nB's share = (2/7) / total profit\n\nB's share = (2/7) / Rs.233,734.78\n\nB's share = 0.00000858\n\nThis means that B's share of the total profit was 0.00000858. We can convert this to a percentage by multiplying by 100:\n\nB's share = 0.00000858 * 100\n\nB's share = 0.00858%\n\nThis means that B's share of the total profit was 0.00858%.\n\n-->\n\nC END"}

This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as (x-y)(x+y+1) = 0. Since we're looking for values of x and y for which it's impossible that p = q, we want values of x and y for which it's impossible to solve this equation. The only way for this equation to have no solutions is if both factors are 0. This happens when x = y or when x = -y - 1. However, if x = y, then p = q, so this isn't what we're looking for.

The circumference of a circle is equal to 2 times pi times the radius. In this case, the radius is 4 centimeters, so the circumference is 2 times pi times 4, or 8 pi. \n\nNext, we need to find the area of the can. The area of a cylinder is equal to the circumference of the base (which we just found to be 8 pi) times the height of the cylinder. In this case, the height is 24 centimeters, so the area of the cylinder is 8 pi times 24, or 192 pi. \n\nNow, we need to find the area of the label. The label is a rectangle, so its area is equal to the length times the width. We know that the length is the circumference of the can (8 pi) and that the width is the height of the cylinder (24 centimeters).
