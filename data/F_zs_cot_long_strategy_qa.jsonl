{"prompt": "In teenagers and young adults with depression, are SSRI medications less safe than they are for adults?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In order to answer this question, we need to first understand what is meant by \"less safe.\" One way to think about safety is in terms of side effects. So, one way to answer this question is to ask whether SSRI medications have more side effects in teenagers and young adults than they do in adults.\n\nThere is some evidence that SSRI medications may have more side effects in teenagers and young adults than they do in adults. For example, one study found that SSRI medications were associated with a greater risk of gastrointestinal side effects in teenagers and young adults than in adults. However, it is important to keep in mind that this study did not directly compare the safety of SSRIs in teenagers and young adults to the safety of SSRIs in adults. Therefore, it is possible that the difference in side effects is due to factors other than the age of the patients.\n\nAnother way to think about safety is in terms of the risk of serious side effects. For example, SSRI medications have been associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people. However, it is important to keep in mind that the absolute risk of these side effects is still very low.\n\nIn conclusion, there is some evidence that SSRI medications may be less safe for teenagers and young adults than they are for adults. However, it is important to keep in mind that the absolute risk of serious side effects is still very low.\n\n-->\n\nYes END"}

{"prompt": "Would Dante have hypothetically placed Nostradamus in 3rd Circle of Hell?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to understand what the 3rd Circle of Hell is. According to Dante's Inferno, the 3rd Circle of Hell is reserved for the Gluttonous. These are the souls who, during their life, allowed themselves to be controlled by their appetites.\n\nNow, we need to think about whether Nostradamus would have fit into this category. Did he allow himself to be controlled by his appetites? It's hard to say for sure, but we can make an educated guess.\n\nNostradamus was a 16th century French physician and astrologer. He is best known for his book Les Propheties, a collection of 942 poetic quatrains allegedly predicting future events. Many of his predictions, such as the rise of Hitler and the 9/11 attacks, have been interpreted retroactively.\n\nGiven that Nostradamus was preoccupied with the future, it's unlikely that he allowed himself to be controlled by his appetites. Instead, he was probably more concerned with his intellectual pursuits. Therefore, it's unlikely that Dante would have placed Nostradamus in the 3rd Circle of Hell.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}

The average African elephant weighs around 6-7 tons. \n\nNext, let's consider the weight of the Hulk. While the Hulk's weight is never explicitly stated in the comics, we can make an estimate based on his size. The Hulk is approximately 7-8 feet tall and 1000 pounds. \n\nNow, let's put the two together. The Hulk is approximately 1000 pounds and the African elephant is approximately 7000 pounds. This means that the African elephant is approximately seven times the weight of the Hulk. \n\nNow, let's think about how much force it would take to crush an African elephant. We know that the Hulk is incredibly strong, and he has been shown to be able to lift weights that are far greater than his own body weight. However, we also know that the African elephant is a very large and sturdy animal. It would take an incredible amount of force to crush an African elephant, even for someone as strong as the Hulk. \n\nSo, to answer your question, it is unlikely that the Hulk would be able to crush an African elephant by simply sitting on its back.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}

{"prompt": "Did Medieval English lords engage in fair trade with peasants?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, what is \"fair trade?\" \n\nThere is no definitive answer, but in general, fair trade is considered to be a system of trade that is based on principles of social justice and sustainability. This means that the people involved in the trade are treated fairly and that the trade itself does not have negative environmental or social impacts.\n\nNow, let's think about whether or not medieval English lords engaged in fair trade with peasants. \n\nThere is no easy answer to this question, as there is no clear definition of what \"fair trade\" is. However, we can look at some specific examples of trade between lords and peasants to see if they meet the general criteria of fair trade. \n\nFor instance, one example of trade between lords and peasants was the system of serfdom, in which peasants were required to work on the lord's land in exchange for protection and the use of some of the lord's resources. This system of trade was not based on principles of social justice, as the peasants were not treated fairly. In addition, the system of serfdom had negative social impacts, as it led to the peasants being oppressed and exploited.

{"prompt": "Can Hulk's alter ego explain atomic events?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to understand what an atom is. \n\nAtoms are the basic units of matter and the defining structure of elements. The term \"atom\" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. \n\nThe structure of an atom is a central nucleus composed of protons and neutrons with electrons orbiting around this nucleus. \n\nNow that we know what an atom is, we can move on to understanding what an atomic event is. \n\nAn atomic event is a process that involves the rearrangement or transformation of the nuclei of atoms. This can happen through natural processes, such as radioactive decay, or through human-made processes, such as nuclear fission or nuclear fusion. \n\nSo, to answer your question, yes, Hulk's alter ego, Bruce Banner, could explain atomic events. He is a highly intelligent scientist with a deep understanding of physics and nuclear science.\n\n-->\n\nYes END"}

{"prompt": "Would a Jehovah's witness approve of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, let's look at the title. \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" includes the word \"adventures,\" which could be interpreted to mean that Alice is engaging in activities that are risky or dangerous. Additionally, the word \"wonderland\" could be interpreted to suggest a place that is strange or magical. Based on these two words alone, it's possible that a Jehovah's Witness might not approve of the book. \n\nNext, let's consider the plot of the book. Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has a series of adventures in a strange, magical place. During her adventures, Alice encounters a number of creatures, including a talking rabbit, a talking caterpillar, and a Cheshire cat. She also attends a tea party with a Mad Hatter and a March Hare. Based on the plot, it's possible that a Jehovah's Witness might not approve of the book because it includes talking animals and magical creatures. \n\nFinally, let's consider the themes of the book. Some of the themes include growing up, being yourself, and standing up for what you believe in. While these themes might be seen as positive by some, a Jehovah's Witness might not approve of the book because it promotes individualism and self-reliance, rather than reliance on God. \n\nIn conclusion, it's possible that a Jehovah's Witness might not approve of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}

Grass-fed beef is going to be more lean than beef that is fed a grain-based diet, and it is also going to have a more intense flavor.\n\nSo, based on these two factors, it is reasonable to conclude that grass-fed beef is going to taste more like wild game than beef that is fed a grain-based diet.\n\n-->\n\nYes END"}

{"prompt": "Did Jesus know anyone who spoke Estonian?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to think about what language Jesus spoke. \n\nThe Bible tells us that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, which was part of the Roman province of Judea. This means that Jesus probably spoke Aramaic, which was the common language in Judea at the time. Aramaic is a Semitic language, which means that it is related to Hebrew and other languages spoken in the Middle East.\n\nHowever, we also know that Jesus spent some time in Egypt, and it is possible that he learned Egyptian as well. We also know that Jesus traveled to other parts of the Roman Empire, so he may have also learned Greek and Latin.\n\nSo, did Jesus know anyone who spoke Estonian? \n\nIt is very unlikely. Estonian is a Finnic language, which means that it is related to Finnish and other languages spoken in Finland and the Baltic region. It is not related to Aramaic, Hebrew, or any other language spoken in the Middle East. \n\nSo, unless Jesus traveled to Estonia (which is very unlikely), it is unlikely that he knew anyone who spoke Estonian.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}

{"prompt": "Would Topa Inca Yupanqui have encountered the western honey bee?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, the western honey bee is not native to the Americas. It is thought to have originated in Africa, and was brought to the Americas by European settlers. \n\nSecond, even if the western honey bee had been present in the Americas prior to the arrival of European settlers, it is unlikely that Topa Inca Yupanqui would have encountered it. Topa Inca Yupanqui was the ninth Sapa Inca of the Kingdom of Cusco, and he ruled from 1471-1493. The Americas were not \"discovered\" by Europeans until 1492, when Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean. \n\nSo, to answer your question, it is unlikely that Topa Inca Yupanqui would have encountered the western honey bee.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}
{"prompt": "Did Alice's Adventures in Wonderland inspire Macbeth?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to look at the plot of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the story, Alice falls down a rabbit hole and has a series of adventures in a strange place called Wonderland. She meets peculiar creatures, including a talking rabbit, and has a series of adventures before finally waking up from her dream. \n\nNow let's look at the plot of Macbeth. The story is about a Scottish general named Macbeth who murders the king in order to take his place. He is wracked with guilt and paranoia, and his reign is ultimately brought to an end by rebellion.\n\nIt's unlikely that Alice's Adventures in Wonderland inspired Macbeth, as the two stories are vastly different. It's possible that Lewis Carroll was inspired by Shakespeare's play when he wrote his own story, but there's no evidence to support this claim.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}

{"prompt": "Did Elizabeth II frequently visit Queen Victoria?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, we need to find out if Elizabeth II was even alive when Queen Victoria was alive. \n\nQueen Victoria was born on May 24, 1819 and died on January 22, 1901. Elizabeth II was born on April 21, 1926. So, no, Elizabeth II was not alive when Queen Victoria was alive. \n\nNext, we need to find out if it would have been possible for Elizabeth II to visit Queen Victoria even if she had been alive when Victoria was alive. \n\nElizabeth II was born in London, and Queen Victoria lived in London for most of her life. So it would have been possible for them to visit each other. \n\nHowever, we need to remember that Elizabeth II was not born into the royal family. Her father, Albert, was the second son of George V and Mary of Teck and was not in line to the throne. Elizabeth II's grandfather, Edward VII, was Queen Victoria's second son. So Elizabeth II would not have been considered royalty when Queen Victoria was alive. \n\nIt is unlikely that Elizabeth II would have visited Queen Victoria even if she had been alive when Victoria was alive, because they would not have had any reason to visit each other.\n\n-->\n\nNo END"}
{"prompt": "Is it unusual to play Happy hardcore music at a funeral?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " First, let's consider what happy hardcore music is. This genre of music is typified by its fast tempo and happy, upbeat atmosphere. \n\nNow, let's think about funerals. Funerals are generally somber occasions, meant to commemorate the life of a person who has passed away. They are not typically happy occasions. \n\nGiven the contrast between the two, it would be unusual to play happy hardcore music at a funeral.\n\n-->\n\nYes END"}
